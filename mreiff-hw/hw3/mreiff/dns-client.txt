Filtered tcpdump output from the Fedora client instance.
This data is only what happened over port 53, which is
the port the DNS is typically transmitted over.

Notes/Annotations:

- The Fedora client instance has the IPv4 address
  10.10.0.33, and the NetBSD server instance has the IPv4
  address of 10.10.0.59. As the server's IPv4 address was
  used to define the DNS server that the client should use,
  all of this traffic was done over IPv4.

- Even though the address 10.10.0.2 was not included
  in the DNS configuration file, it appears that the first
  two packets sent by the client were to this address as
  requests for the A and AAAA records associated with the
  DARPA URL. This address also responds with data after
  the client makes two requests to the properly defined
  DNS server.

- The remainder of the DNS traffic happened between the client
  and the specified DNS server, including repeats of the the
  initial requests for the A and AAAA records.
  
- The client then asks for A and AAAA records for the DARPA
  URL suffixed by edgekey.net, and then makes requests regarding
  CNAME records for a subdomain of akamaiedge.net. These two domains
  are owned by Akamai Technologies, a company which provides "web and
  Internet security services" as well as a CDN.

- The DNS server returns IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for these requests,
  which allow for the client to then connect to the server which is
  used to host DARPA's webpage.
