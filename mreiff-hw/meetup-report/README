I attended a virtual meetup titled "How cloud services help to
mitigate Log4Shell and its friends" hosted by PhillyJUG. In this directory
is my report in two formats: plain text and a formatted PDF (which contains
screenshots of relevant slides from the event). Additionally, I am also
including the slide show that was presented at the event as a PDF for reference.
