Lecture 02 (1/31/21)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week two lecture playlist and read
the "File Systems and Storage Models" chapter linked on the course web
page.

I have completed the second week's self check questionnaire.

I have completed HW1 and submitted my document. In the process of doing this,
I have successfully configured my system to use the `aws-cli` package as well
as added the supplied `awsaliases` file to system so I can make use of them.

As I have volunteered to do a paper/article presentation for this week, I
have taken time to find a topic and prepare a demonstration to show in class
as a proof of concept.

Question: Could a near infinite number of inodes be "generated" by storing
files on virtual disks as a VM does? Do these disk image files only occupy
1 inode on the host while allowing for many inodes to be used within them,
or are inodes used on virtual drives also used on the host drive?
