Lecture 02 (1/31/21)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week two lecture playlist and read
the "File Systems and Storage Models" chapter linked on the course web
page.

I have completed the second week's self check questionnaire.

I have completed HW1 and submitted my document. In the process of doing this,
I have successfully configured my system to use the `aws-cli` package as well
as added the supplied `awsaliases` file to system so I can make use of them.

As I have volunteered to do a paper/article presentation for this week, I
have taken time to find a topic and prepare a demonstration to show in class
as a proof of concept.

Question: Could a near infinite number of inodes be "generated" by storing
files on virtual disks as a VM does? Do these disk image files only occupy
1 inode on the host while allowing for many inodes to be used within them,
or are inodes used on virtual drives also used on the host drive?

After Class:
-------------------
Important takeaways:
- Inodes contain:
	- disk blocks
	- permissions
	- type
	- size
	- number of links
	- owner
	- timestamps
- Generally, a SAN will be faster than a NAS, however this depends on the
  hardware and may not always be true
- AWS likely uses a SAN to allocate disk space to instances.
- An AWS instance does not know that it is running on AWS, however it might
  know that it is virtual due to needing specific drivers to load virtual hardware.
- Normally on a Unix file system, 100% disk usage does not mean that 100% of
  the disk is used. The super user can continue to fill the disk 

I really enjoyed the first in class presentation about log4j. While it was
something that I have read about in the past and have seen demonstrations,
I never truly understood what was happening behind the scenes to make it work.
The presentation was very insightful and the live professor's demo helped me
understand how the exploit functions.
