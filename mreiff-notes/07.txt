Lecture 07 (3/7/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week seven lecture playlist on youtube
as well as read the three blog posts linked on the course site.

I have completed the seventh week's self check questionnaire, as well as
took time to finalize my work on HW2. This assignment took much longer than
I expected it to, however I was still able to complete it on time.

I found the reading about DoT, DoH and DNSSEC very interesting, as it is
very fascinating seeing multiple standards designed to accomplish similar
tasks do so in different ways.
