Lecture 07 (3/7/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week seven lecture playlist on youtube
as well as read the three blog posts linked on the course site.

I have completed the seventh week's self check questionnaire, as well as
took time to finalize my work on HW2. This assignment took much longer than
I expected it to, however I was still able to complete it on time.

I found the reading about DoT, DoH and DNSSEC very interesting, as it is
very fascinating seeing multiple standards designed to accomplish similar
tasks do so in different ways.

After class:
-------------------
On the visual traceroute, some locations may not be geographically correct
due to IP addresses not having an official database, but rather privately
made ones.

We only have 13 main root servers due to UDP packet size limitation.
TCP can handle more data than UDP, and you can choose to use it over UDP
if configured to do so.

When using a caching resolver, the URL is broken up by each of it's segments
Ex: www.cs.stevens.edu
- connect to a root server to first check edu
- then stevens.edu
- then cs.stevens.edu
- finally www.cs.stevens.edu
When doing the same with an IP address, it will treaty it as a domain:
IP.in-addr.arpa, and do the same kind of search.

DNS by default does not have security. DoT and DoH are meant to solve that.

HTTP is now the "universal internet" protocol; the most widely used version
is 1.1. RFC2616
