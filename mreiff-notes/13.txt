Lecture 13 (4/25/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have read the two blog posts linked on the course site, and
was disappointed to not see any associated youtube videos for this week's
content.

I have completed the week 13 checkpoint questionnaire, and have completed my
work on HW4. This week was a bulk of the programming and ultimately spent much
of my spare learning about shell. In the end, I created a solution with 3
scripts in it:
- A script to make backups
- A script to assist with restoring from backups
- A script to nuke the backups so the user can start over again

I forgot to mention this in previous notes, so I will do so here. On 4/12/22,
I attended a meetup hosted by PhillyJUG titled "How cloud services help to
mitigate Log4Shell and its friends". I have included the report in the same
directory where I keep my homework assignments.
