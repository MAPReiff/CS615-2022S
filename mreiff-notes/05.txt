Lecture 05 (2/22/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week five lecture playlist and read the WHOIS:
Fragile, unparseable, obsolete... and universally relied upon" chapter linked on
the course site.

I have completed the fifth week's self check questionnaire.

I found some of the concepts discussed in the last lecture video to be very interesting,
such as peering and how networks are connected to other networks.

I have started to work on the second homework assignment regarding packet capture by doing
some further research into the concepts and software needed to complete the assignment.
