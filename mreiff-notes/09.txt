Lecture 09 (3/28/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week nine lecture playlist on youtube.
These were not linked on the course site as they normally are, so I am
unsure if I even needed to watch them this week. I have also read the
two chapters and two blog posts linked on the course site.

Additionally, I have looked at the `shell basics` file and completed the
weekly self check questionnaire. I have also started to look at HW4 as it
was linked in this week's materials. As we have a month to do this assignment,
I will assume that it is more work that it appears to be and will get started
on it soon.
