Lecture 03 (2/7/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week three lecture playlist and read
the "Software Installation and Package Management" chapter linked on the
course site.

I have completed the third week's self check questionnaire.

I have followed along with the examples shown in the videos regarding
manually writing to a disk to store files and define MBR partitions.

As there was no homework assignment due this week, I instead spent my time
doing further research into the topics and doing more proof of concept exercises
so I can become more familiar with the subjects.
