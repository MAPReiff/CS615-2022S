Lecture 06 (2/28/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week six lecture playlist on youtube and as
well as reviewed last week's materials to refresh the concepts in my mind. As we
did not have a lecture last week, I have used the time to try and further familiarize
myself with networking concepts to help me understand the course's current content.

There does not appear to be a self check questionnaire this week on the course website,
so I dedicated the time I would normally spend completing it to work on homework #2.

I found the `ktrace` command (and by extension the `strace` and `dtrace` commands) mentioned
in the video to be very fascinating. A way to know what system calls are being made by a
command is an easy way to demystify what might otherwise just be seen as a black box, as
most of the times when I run a command I usually know what it will do, but not how it will
accomplish it.
