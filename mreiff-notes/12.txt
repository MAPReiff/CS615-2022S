Lecture 12 (4/18/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week twelve lecture recordings linked on the
course site which appear to overlap with week 11's content. I have also
reviewed the two blog posts linked on the course site.

I have completed the week 12 checkpoint questionnaire, and have continued my
work on HW4. This week, I have started the actual programming portion of the
assignment after completing the initial design phase. I decided to do this
assignment in shell, as I determined it would be easier to do than attempting
to do so in Node as I would need to also instruct the user on how to install
Node and npm as well as instruct them on how to run the program with node.
Additionally, I believe that this is an excellent opportunity to get more
familiar with shell scripting.
