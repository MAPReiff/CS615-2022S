Lecture 04 (2/14/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week four lecture playlist and re read the
"Software Installation and Package Management" chapter and read the "Of Users
and Groups" chapter linked on the course site.

I have completed the fourth week's self check questionnaire.

I have followed along with the example exercises regarding adding new users
and package managers.

As there was no homework assignment due this week, I dedicated more of my spare
time to doing the above mentioned examples, as well as some further research into
the topics in order to better my understanding of them. I have run through a few
tutorials regarding operting systerms from scratch in order to get some hands on
experince.
