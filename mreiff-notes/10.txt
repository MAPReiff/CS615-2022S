Lecture 10 (4/4/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week ten lecture recordings linked on the course
site which appear to overlap with week 9's content. I have also reviewed the `Backup
Exercise` and `tar` pages linked on the site

I have completed the week 10 checkpoint questionnaire, and have gotten started doing
research in order to complete HW4 regarding EBS backups. This research has taken up
much of the time I would normally dedicate to this class this past week.
