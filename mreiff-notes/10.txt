Lecture 10 (4/4/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week ten lecture recordings linked on the course
site which appear to overlap with week 9's content. I have also reviewed the `Backup
Exercise` and `tar` pages linked on the site

I have completed the week 10 checkpoint questionnaire, and have gotten started doing
research in order to complete HW4 regarding EBS backups. This research has taken up
much of the time I would normally dedicate to this class this past week.


After class:
-------------------
Possible backup problems
- local i/o constancy problem
- how do you act when there is not enough space; how do you know how much you need?
	- EBS has a volume size limitation
	- could compress things
	- mandate max size/age
	- could raid EBS volumes
	- could split files across multiple volumes
- incremental vs full backup
- Write to EBS
	- make volume
	- make an instance
	- write to the file system or write to a raw disk
- local steps
	- calculate the size needed
	- create an instance
	- create a volume/re use a volume
	- read data and send over network
- remote steps
	- receive data from network and write it to a disk
- on either side you can
	- encrypt
	- compress

Example workflow
- local: dump
- ssh data transfer
- remote: dd

event: something that happens at a place and time

A good way to review logs is to visualize it: graphs
