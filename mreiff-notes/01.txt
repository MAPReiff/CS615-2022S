Lecture 01 (1/24/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have reviewed the course's web page to determine what to expect
during this semester as well as what is expected of me before the first class.

I have completed the first week self check questionnaire.

I have reviewed the 6 video segments for week 1, read through chapters 1, 2 and 3
of the course book, as well as SAGE Job Descriptions for System Administrators
document linked on the course's web page.

I have been granted access to the Stevens Linux Lab server, however I am unable to
connect to it as the connection times out when I try to ssh into it. I am still
waiting on a response to my ticket.

I have registered for AWS.


After class:
----------------
Important takeaways:
    - 3 core principles: security, scalability, simplicity.
    - "Sysadmins are lazy"
    - HW 1 is related to AWS; I have signed up for a student account with the link
      on the course web page.
    - The linux lab is currently non accessible so assignments must be done using my
      local machine (such as spawning AWS instances for HW1).
    - I will need to start thinking of a topic that I would like to present on as
      one of the weekly topic presentations. I might want to volunteer for week 2 since
      file systems are interesting and I have some experience.
    - I also need to start thinking about a meet up to attend that is related to the course.

I really enjoyed the start of the class where we used basic command line tools to gather
information about and debug the connection to the linux lab server. I have previously used
the `dig`, `host`, and `whois` commands, however the `traceroute` command is something which
I had never used. I liked that I was able to both watch it be used over zoom and try it on my
own machine in real time with a proper example of when a sysadmin would make use of such commands.
