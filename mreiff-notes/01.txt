Lecture 01 (1/24/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have reviewed the course's web page to determine what to expect
during this semester as well as what is expected of me before the first class.

I have completed the first week self check questionnaire.

I have reviewed the 6 video segments for week 1, read through chapters 1, 2 and 3
of the course book, as well as SAGE Job Descriptions for System Administrators
document linked on the course's web page.

I have been granted access to the Stevens Linux Lab server, however I am unable to
connect to it as the connection times out when I try to ssh into it. I am still
waiting on a response to my ticket.

I have registered for AWS.
