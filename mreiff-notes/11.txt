Lecture 11 (4/11/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week eleven lecture recordings linked on the
course site which appear to overlap with week 10's content. I have also reviewed
the `Configuration Management`  chapter linked on the course site.

I have completed the week 11 checkpoint questionnaire, and have continued my
work on HW4. I am finalizing my planning for how I will execute this assignment
and plan to start work on the actual bulk of the assignment this coming week.

After class:
-------------------
Project: 
- backup: tar cf - . | ssh amazon "cat >/mount"
- restore: ssh amazon "cat /mount" | tar xf -

The point of a CM is not to make changes on a system, it is to get it to a ready
state and/or to recover a system

CM can be a pull model or a push model, and can be for more than just servers

CM overlaps with:
- software deployment
- monitoring
- revision control and audit logs
- compliance enforcement
- etc

Don't update
- you might update and GAIN a vulnerability/bug
- might break something
- leads to tracking (when you pull packages someone can track that)

Always update
- newest might fix stuff you didn't know needed fixes
- exercises pipeline

When updating, you need a test pipeline to verify new software is good; hard
to do at scale
