Lecture 11 (4/11/22)
=========
Before class:
-------------------
Prior to class, I have watched the week eleven lecture recordings linked on the
course site which appear to overlap with week 10's content. I have also reviewed
the `Configuration Management`  chapter linked on the course site.

I have completed the week 11 checkpoint questionnaire, and have continued my
work on HW4. I am finalizing my planning for how I will execute this assignment
and plan to start work on the actual bulk of the assignment this coming week.
